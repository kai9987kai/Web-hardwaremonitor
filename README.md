## Technical Details
- The dashboard is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Charts are created using Chart.js library.
- Animations are powered by Anime.js library.
- The dashboard uses simulated data for CPU and GPU usage, as real-time hardware information is not typically accessible through web browsers for security reasons.

## Notes
- This dashboard is for educational and demonstration purposes.
- Some features (like detailed CPU and GPU usage) are simulated and do not reflect actual system performance.
- IP information is fetched from an external API (ipapi.co) and may be subject to rate limiting or service availability.
